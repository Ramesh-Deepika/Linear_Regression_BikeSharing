# Bike sharing assignment on Linear Regression
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price  or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user  enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
